Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
branch of computer science used for developing,maintaining and testing software
1.security-it implements measures to protect data from cyber threats and breaches
2.scalability and flexibility-
it ensures that the system can andle an increas load without affecting performance
3.efficiency-it helps developer optimeze workflow while maintaining high standards

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering compexity
mastering process
mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
design-building framework
coding-converting software desing into tangible code
plannin-identfy the software requirement 
requirements analylis-identify the final user specification
maintaenance and support-kep software functional and updated

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
agile methodology
high flexibility
regular customer feedback is incorported nto every sprint
testing is continuous and done after each iteration
waterfalll methodology
low flexibilty
customer feedback comes late when the product is developed
testing is done at the end of the development process

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
maintaing and updatin software to keep it functional
reporting to the manager about the progress of the software
Quality Assurance Engineer
create development standards and procedures for the programmer to follow 
analyse the product and suggest changes to make them more efficient
Project Manager
tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone
create blueprint for the project
Dxiscuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
-An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
-IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
-The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
-Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Limited Infrastructure-limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
Changing Software Requirements-software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
Software Security-programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability-overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests-consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
Interatin units-verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System units-Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance unit-formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements.They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.
  
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
-Makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
- A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns
- A prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Create a report on technology."
Improved Prompt:
"Write a 2-page report on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, focusing on its benefits, challenges, and future trends. Use credible sources and include real-world examples."

Why is it more effective:
1. Clarity–Instead of just "technology," the topic is now focused on AI in healthcare.
2. Specific Requirements–It specifies length (2 pages), key aspects (benefits, challenges, future trends), and the need for credible sources.
3. Concise–The user knows exactly what to include, reducing ambiguity and ensuring a relevant response.
